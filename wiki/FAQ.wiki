Q: What's with the weird hxx file?
A: If you've ever tried to read template code in C++ (like stl, or parts of boost), you would probably have been very confused at some point in time.  One of the reasons for this is because C++ requires you to place the implementation of the templated function/class in the header.  In order to address this legibility problem, we decided to make template files read like non-template files.  We achieve this by placing the class/function definitions in the .h files (much like non-template files), and the implementation in the .hxx files (much like the .cpp or .c files).  To satisfy the "templates must be in headers" requirement, we simply include the .hxx files at the bottom of the .h file.  With this little trick we achieved 2 things:
  #The client of the code can easily open up the .h file to learn about the interface without being concerned with the implementation.
  #The client can simply include the .h file and be non-the-wiser
